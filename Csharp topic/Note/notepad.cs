     *Data type is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system 
    how to interpret its value in c#. examples are: int,string,bool,double,decimal,char,long,float
    *Operators are use to perform operations on varaibles and values

    *string is used to store a sequesnce of character
    *Array is use to store multiple values in a single variable[]
    *if,else,else if, are all conditional statement
    *namespaces are use to organise code and collection of classes,delegate,enum and interface
    *Methods are block of code containing series of statement and only runs when called
    *class contains data and logic , it is a templates for object
    *Inheritance helps to reduces time and error , it allows code reuseaility(:)
    *structs is like a class used to encapsulate data and related functions, it help to keep data in check.
    *it can also inherit from interface
    *Acess modifiers controls the visibility of a class.
    *public,private,protected,internal,protected internal
    *Interfaces are completely abstract class that contains abstract methods and property
    *enums are strongly tyoed constant, it is used whem you have values that are not going to change
    *Generics class  allows you to design your class and method decoupled of any datatype i.e 
    *in a way that you can input any type of data without affecting your code
    *Delegate are type save functions that is points to a function. 
    *the signature of the delegate must match the signature of the function it is pouinting to
    *Events is a special kind of multicast delegate;n
